Betrayed by Boosie Badazz
[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Dear God
I ask you to make my heart cold tonight
From all strangers all bustas
You know what im talking about?
Father God I been betrayed
Cause I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
How many niggas been betrayed out there tonight
Plenty of times nigga
Nigga don't keep it real no more

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
After all the fucking shit we done been through (huh bruh)
All the pussy niggas we done tend to (huh bruh)
But it don't mean nothing when a nigga money low
Niggas will shoot you in the back and cut yo fucking throat like Rich and Alpo
Now its hard for me to trust somebody
Family neither they'll steal if they know you got it
God forgive me I been hurt by a couple niggas
That's why I wake up say my prayers and be like fuck a nigga
Bitches want riches so they trying to slide the rubber off trying to get pregnant
When you stupid hoes gon' learn yo lesson (mm mm mm)
Man it seem like the mo love you show a nigga
When you fall off you be like damn did I know this nigga
I'm glad I rap cuz these days they testify
Nigga ain't catch you with nothin' and he got 25
Just cuz he say he gon' ride don't mean he loyal dawg
It's Cain and Abel again forgive us father God
[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
They criticize me huh, they talk about me bad
Ain't nobody wanna sign me, I had to show my ass
If I love you ain't no question i'd give my last
One day this heart gonna get me zipped up in a body bag
What about ya first love? Huh she played it cold didn't it?
Made a nigga shed a tear and she changed a nigga
So we fuck'em and dump'em never trust'em or love'em
No need for friends, fuck friends, friends turn into bustas
Momma gonna tell ya when that nigga ain't right (momma know!)
Momma know because she pray every night
I done and wash my hands with all this pussy shit
Niggas be hating but Boosie Boo he hood rich
On top of that I'm a Scorpio so I'm unforgivable
First time you fuck with me dog I let them killas go
I'm down and dirty cause a nigga heard me
Geefus supposed to be dead but I let him slide cause he ain't worth it
[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Feel like somebody burning candles on me
That's why that choppa in my phantom and my house got all them cameras on it
Know I'm standing under the light
So I just try to do right
Ain't been in church but I pray every night
Its like I used to didn't give a fuck
But over the years I don learned and I got out here
And earned so much to live for
My niggas tell me slow it down for real you need to chill bruh
Stay up on your grind, take your time, bring your kids up
My grandma told me look at you look what the streets done did to ya
Alot of niggas done changed on me
I came up they switched up my daughter almost died, man it all seem wrong
The only thing good is my dog came home
My mind gone my heart mad my soul so pissed
I think my niggas tried to rob me, that's some fucked up shit
Blowing killa when I ride, in my mirror when I ride by
Can see some niggas doing a coward-ass drive-by
Some of these pussies really think that they got 9 lives
You might as well don't even bust back
Cause this bitch 100 shots
And we been getting it by the pound
You know we blunted out
Something fancy stunt it out
Throwing money out
[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

Freestyle by Lil Baby
[Intro]
DaVinci (DaVinci, DaVinci)
Yeah
Shoutout the whole Oakland City, man
You know what I'm saying? The whole 4PF
Know what I'm saying? I put this up
Yeah

[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no ho
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain't my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
'Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gon' fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta that when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos on Dracos on Dracos on Dracos
40s on 40s on 40s
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Get a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lurkin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
[Outro]
Yeah

Close Friends by Lil Baby
[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time
[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel
They ain't get it but they ain't our problem
What the fuck can they do about it?

All My Life by Lil Durk
[Intro: J. Cole]
Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge

[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I decided I had to finish
But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but
[Chorus: Choir, Lil Durk & J. Cole]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)

They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down, yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', "Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb"
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age
[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

Star Shopping by Lil Peep
[Verse]
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces
[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason1.4K

Mona Lisa by Lil Wayne
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"—"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, "Ooh"
[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me a salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh,"
