My Beyoncé by Lil Durk
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ooh, I like the way she move
Shorty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby, I know they so confused
Shorty my Beyoncé
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shorty my Beyoncé
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyoncé

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Trippin' on that drank, but I know she worth it
Independent baby, I know she workin'
Adriana's serving drinks, 20 bottles, urgent
I know it can be better but nobody's perfect
We flirted for a minute, DeJ, that's my baby
I ain't trippin', I'm like Henny, yeah I'm in her kidneys
She like to play her songs to the way I'm hittin' it
Turn around like, "Damn Durk, I like the way you hittin' it"
Don't believe the rumors, girl
You know I'll do you, girl
I don't wanna hear the shit about the niggas
That tried to do you, girl
Fuck the past right now
Shawty got you right now
And you hot right now
You can get it right now, baby

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I let him get it when he want it, knock it down and push up on it
I was plottin' for a while, now I got him where I want him
They didn't understand none of this was planned
99 problems but a bitch better not be none
Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel
They ain't get it but they ain't our problem
What the fuck can they do about it?
Durk and DeJ
I'm thinkin' 'bout changin' my last name
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ooh, I like the way she move
Shorty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby, I know they so confused

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
You and I
White dress, flowers, and a suit and tie
Me and you like Bonnie and Clyde
No beat the case, we're do or die
Who am I to say you ain't natural?
Your haters my haters, ain't switchin' up, baby, I got you
I'm with her like a tattoo
The way you wear that dress, they gon' attack you
The way you look at me, baby, I got you
I hit it from the front, I like the back too
She say, "Lay down so I can ride you"
I know that she fiending
She scratchin' my back, I like how she screamin'
I fuck her and leave her, she fiending
Shawty my Beyoncé
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ooh, I like the way she move
Shorty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby, I know they so confused

Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shorty my Beyoncé
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyoncé

[Outro: Lil Durk]
Ooh, ooh
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Ooh, ooh

All My Life by Lil Durk
[Intro: J. Cole]
Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge

[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break mе (No, no)
They couldn't take me, thеy couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I decided I had to finish
But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', "Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb"
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age
[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
