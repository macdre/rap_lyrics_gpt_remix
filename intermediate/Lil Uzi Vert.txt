XO Tour Llif3 by Lil Uzi Vert
[Intro]
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8 (Yeah)
Countin' them bands
All way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
Wanna blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "I am not afraid to die" (Yeah)
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (Yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence (Yeah)
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Make some, lil' nigga, take some (Yeah, yeah)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would become (Yeah)
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, "You're the worst, you're the worst"
I cannot die because this my universe
[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things (Yeah)
Iced out heart on your neck tried to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the ring (Damn, yeah)
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man's a lame
