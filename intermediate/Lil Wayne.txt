Love Me by Lil Wayne
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Mike WiLL Made-It)
I got some down bitches I can call (What's hatnin'?)
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall (I'ma ball, ball, ball)

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me (Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah; EarDrummers; yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I can give a fuck 'bout no nigga
Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
Uh, with no makeup, she a ten (Ten)
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

Mona Lisa by Lil Wayne
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"—"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, "Ooh"

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me a salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh,"
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," dead emotion (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah
